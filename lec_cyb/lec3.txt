			AntiVirus

Attempts to detect malware on our systems
Great for known malware but
Malware is always evolving
Some AV's are better than others

Heuristics is the method of making rules that identify things that look like
malware. If something is opening network ports it might be a virus. If it uses
crypto libraries all the time these things are unusual for many programs

Encoding malicous code and making sure it only get decoded at runtime that makes it easier for your virus to get through any antivurses.
